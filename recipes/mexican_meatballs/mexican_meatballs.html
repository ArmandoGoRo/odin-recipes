                <li>Mix the minced meat in a bowl along with your egg, the bread crumbs and the oregano, seasoning it with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>With a pair of scissors, cut your "ancho" and "guajillo" peppers in half to remove the seeds and the veins (this will remove some of the spicyness).</li>
                <li>Cut the rest of the vegetables in half, put them along with your peppers in a pot with enough water to cover everything.</li>
                <li>Bring the pot to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes, or until the peppers soften.</li>
                <li>Pass the contents from the pot to a blender, add some of the water from the boil and grind it into a fine sauce.</li>
                <li>Start assembling your meatballs.</li>
                <li>Put a pot with oil on a medium fire. Once the oil is hot, pour in your sauce. Season to taste.</li>
                <li>Once your sauce is starting to boil, add your meatballs.</li>
                <li>Bring the pot to a simmer, cover with a lid, lower the flame and let cook for an hour, moving with a wooden spoon every 20 minutes to ensure the meatballs don't stick to the pan and burn.</li>
                <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
