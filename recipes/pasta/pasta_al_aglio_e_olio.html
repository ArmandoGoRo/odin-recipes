        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Pasta can often feel like a complicated and expensive dish to pull off, especially when you try to make an elaborate sauce and use special kinds of pasta.</p>
        <p class="description">However, this recipe shines because of its simplicity and practicality, returning to the base of good homemade pasta with spaghetti and olive oil.</p>
        <p class="description">As long as you have 20 minutes and the urge to eat something other than prepared food, you can whip this up in no time, and even have some leftovers.</p>
